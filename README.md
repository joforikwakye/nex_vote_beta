# nex_vote_beta

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

A new Flutter project. Nex Vote as we call it is a 3rd year software engineering project made by Group Nexus. So the name comes from a blend of the group's name and what the application does. Nex Vote is an application that would enable students of Kwame Nkrumah University Of Science And Technology (KNUST) be able to vote from anywhere on campus. The application is not fully complete and a team of developers are constantly working around the clock to make this app come to life. This repository was created to help keep track of the changes made to the app and also allow the team collaborate at any point in time.
