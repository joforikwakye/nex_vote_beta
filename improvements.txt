HOW THE APPLICATION CAN BE IMPROVED.

1. CONCERNING THE COLOURS AND FONTS, WE HAVE TO EXTRACT THE COMMON ITEMS AND MAKE THEM BE CHANGED ONCE. 
LIKE AN APPBAR IS CONSTANT WITH SOME TEXT AND COLOUR. THE COLOUR SHOULD BE MADE CONSTANT THROGHOUT THE ENTIRE APPBAR
AND THE TEXT WOULD BE PASSED BY THE CALLLING CLASS.

2. IMAGES COULD BE STORED ONLINE AND NOT IN THE APP TO REDUCE THE SIZE AND BUILD TIME OF THE APP

3. THERE IS A LOT OF REPITITION GOING ON. WE MUST FIND A WAY OF REDUCING THE CLASSES AND CODE.

4. UNDER THE DEPARTMENT_CANDIDATES FOLDER, YOU CAN SEE I HAVE DIVIDED THE FILES FOR THE POSITIONS INTO SEPARATE WIDGETS
BUT THE PROBLEM IS HOW DO I MAKE THE IMAGES UNIQUE FOR CLASSES THAT ARE SHARING THE SAME RESOURCES. I.E THE PRESIDENTS, FINSEC, GENSEC
ONE WAY OF FIXING THIS IS BY CREATING SAME WIDGETS BUT WITH DIFFERENT NAMES FOR THE DIFFERENT DEPARTMENTS. LIKE PRESIDENT_BIOMED.

5. WHEN WE DETECT WHICH DEPARTMENT FROM WHICH YOU ARE SIGNING IN FROM, THEN WE DISPLAY THE APPROPRIATE PLACES YOU CAN VOTE
